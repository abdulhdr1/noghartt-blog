I have a strong believe that most of the time, there is a clear separation
between two concerns: software engineering and coding. Both look similar, both
work together, but they aren't the same.

Software engineering is more than coding on the aspect that envolves more about
your work than just your pull request at GitHub. It's more about the processes
and patterns that you apply through your workflow that impacts what I mean by
engineering here, in this blog post.

Software engineering is about the guarantee that, from the macro perspective,
the product and the code that are you working on will correspond to the
expectations that they have, both from the product and technical sides.

About the product side, it follows the expectations around the culture and what
your company, product or anything else you working has, like:

- If it is what the customer wants;
- If will bring some quality of life improvement for your customer;
- If will be a building block for a greater feature,
- And anything else  that gives a clear objective for the final customer.
  Assuming that your _"customer"_ here could be anything in that scenario
  that will consume the product that you are working on.

About the technical side, the core properties that should be follow in my vision
are:

- The guarantee that everything related to your code
  will follow the expectations around the patterns, the code guidelines that have
  been discussed in your company, project, etc.
- Ensure that your feature have been tested, by yourself, by systematic tests,
  here being any kind of test (integration, unit, property, end-to-end, anything).
- Ensure that the documentations are available and up-to-date accordingly to the
  expectations that you and your coworkers have around the feature/code that you
  are working on.
- Ensure that the code won't break the existing codebase.

About my thoughts around what I believe that are a responsibility of software
engineers that are more than coding, I will wrote some of my thoughts below:

## Documentations as a Resource for the Future

Documentation is one of the most important part of a project, in my opinion.
It's about the guarantee that the decisions and the resources that you have at
the moment you wrote a code have been saved in a way that can be validated in the
future, by yourself or any other developer that will need to maintain your code.

Having a powerful context of the past decisions brings for the table the ability
to review it and understand why some options have been took or not. Some projects
have been wrote by people that isn't on the company anymore and you can't contact
them, then think how much easy would be for you when you try to run that old
project if they have at least one documentation about _"How to run Project X"_.

Documentation brings to you a safe guarantee that, in the future, yourself from
the past prepared all the place answering some of the future doubts that could
exists.

Documentation should be a atemporal feature for anyone that wants to build
a resilient, scalable, and maintainable software.

## Tests as The Reinforcement Guarantee

If your code isn't supported by tests, your code isn't production-ready. I would
say that for the majority of scenarios, you should have at least 1 test that
guarantee the behavior of a given scope.

Recently, I read a great piece of blog posts from Matklad: [How to Test](https://matklad.github.io/2021/05/31/how-to-test.html),
it brings some great material around how you could exactly test your software.
And I believe that a strong software should be test oriented, in a perspective
where you have the guarantee that, even if you inserted some specific new thing
at your system, the feedback loop of the tests that you have will ensure that, if
something have been break, it will be caught up.

Tests are the proof that the _axioms_ of your systems, the rules and the guarantee
that your system will be working on a specific way. They aren't about what exactly
users shouldn't do, but it's the guarantee that, based on what users really can do,
you won't have a breaking change.

Tests also let you move fast, with the security that if there is any breaking
change, it will be easily caught by those ones.

In any other kind of engineering, you have tests, redundancy, and tools that
provides safety through their work, like a civil engineer building a bridge.
Tests, for software engineers, follow the same idea.

## Migrations and Refactors as Engineers

As [Linus said some time ago](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFy98A+LJK4+GWMcbzaa1zsPBRo76q+ioEjbx-uaMKH6Uw@mail.gmail.com/):

> WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!

At the moment that your code goes to production, you have more concerns than just
the usability of your code. How many people will be using it? How a breaking
change will impact them if you inserted a new one? What are the implications?
The second and third order effects of those changes? Can you think of the entire
chain of consequences of this action?

You, as an engineer, should be carefully thoughtful about the decisions in your
code. The implications of a specific change can impact a lot of customers in a
harmful way that even you can't imagine.

[Backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility)
is a term that I liked a lot. Being the guarantee of the interoperability of an
older system (as said by Wikipedia), at the software side, it's the guarantee that
we will guarantee the same behavior of our APIs even for old clients.

Even for internal tooling or between shared modules across your codebase, you
should carefully think in backward compatibility. You will always have a consumer
of an API and, in that scenario, your API is the interface that have been exported
by your functions and being consumed in other side of your codebase. The guarantee
that it won't break, or that will changed in every place, is a guarantee of less
entropy through your entire codebase.

## Conclusion

This is what I believe that are some specific part of a job of a software engineer,
coding is one of the easier parts of the job. You have a lot more concerns to thought
about your product, your code and other related aspect of the company.

And I believe that we should be more engineers and not just developers.
